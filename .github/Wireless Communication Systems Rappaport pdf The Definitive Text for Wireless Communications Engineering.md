## Signal Propagation
 
Signal propagation is the process of transmitting and receiving electromagnetic waves through a medium, such as air, water, or cable. Signal propagation is affected by various factors, such as distance, frequency, antenna characteristics, reflection, refraction, diffraction, scattering, fading, and interference. These factors can cause signal attenuation, distortion, delay, and noise.
 
To analyze and design wireless communication systems, we need to understand the mathematical models and techniques for signal propagation. The Wireless Communication Systems Rappaport PDF introduces the concepts of path loss, shadowing, multipath fading, Doppler shift, coherence time and bandwidth, and channel models. It also explains how to measure and predict signal propagation using empirical formulas and ray tracing methods.
 
## Modulation
 
Modulation is the process of changing the characteristics of a carrier wave according to a message signal. Modulation enables us to transmit information over a wireless channel with limited bandwidth and power. Modulation can be classified into two types: analog modulation and digital modulation.
 
Analog modulation is the modulation of a continuous carrier wave by a continuous message signal. Examples of analog modulation are amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), and phase modulation (PM). Digital modulation is the modulation of a discrete carrier wave by a discrete message signal. Examples of digital modulation are amplitude shift keying (ASK), frequency shift keying (FSK), phase shift keying (PSK), quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).
 
The Wireless Communication Systems Rappaport PDF explains the principles and methods of analog and digital modulation. It also discusses the performance measures of modulation schemes, such as bandwidth efficiency, power efficiency, bit error rate (BER), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
