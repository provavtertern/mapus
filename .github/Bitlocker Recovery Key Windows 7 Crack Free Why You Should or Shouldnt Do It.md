## What is BitLocker Recovery Key?
 
BitLocker recovery key is a 48-digit code that is generated when you encrypt a drive using BitLocker. It is used to unlock the drive in case you forget your password or your system changes. You can save the recovery key to your Microsoft account, a USB flash drive, a paper document, or a TXT file.

## Why Do You Need to Crack BitLocker Recovery Key?
 
There are some situations where you may need to crack BitLocker recovery key on Windows 7, such as:
 
- You forgot your password and lost your recovery key.
- You changed your motherboard or other hardware components and triggered BitLocker protection.
- You encountered a system crash or malware attack that corrupted your BitLocker encryption.
- You want to access someone else's encrypted drive without their permission.

However, cracking BitLocker recovery key is not easy. BitLocker uses strong encryption algorithms and requires a lot of computing power and time to brute-force. Moreover, there are some security features that prevent unauthorized access to BitLocker-protected drives, such as:

- TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip that stores encryption keys and verifies system integrity.
- PIN (Personal Identification Number) that adds an extra layer of authentication.
- Divisibility by 11 check that validates each group of six digits in the recovery key.

## How to Crack BitLocker Recovery Key on Windows 7 for Free?
 
There are some tools and methods that claim to be able to crack BitLocker recovery key on Windows 7 for free. However, they are not guaranteed to work and may pose some risks to your data and system. Therefore, we do not recommend using them unless you have no other choice and you are aware of the consequences. Here are some of them:
 
### Method 1: Use BitCracker
 
BitCracker is a tool that performs a dictionary attack on BitLocker recovery key. It requires a list of possible recovery keys that meet the special conditions of BitLocker (see [this answer](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/128292/how-would-i-brute-force-a-bitlocker-recovery-key) for details). It also supports GPU acceleration to speed up the process.
 
To use BitCracker, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download BitCracker from [its GitHub page](https://github.com/e-ago/bitcracker).
2. Create a list of possible recovery keys in a TXT file.
3. Create an image of your encrypted drive using a tool like FTK Imager.
4. Run BitCracker with the image file and the list file as inputs.
5. Wait for BitCracker to find the correct recovery key or stop if it fails.

### Method 2: Use Passware Kit Forensic
 
Passware Kit Forensic is a software that can recover passwords and decrypt files and
