Everest is a 2015 biographical survival adventure film that depicts the real events of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, in which several climbers lost their lives during a summit attempt. The film stars an ensemble cast of Jason Clarke, Jake Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin, John Hawkes, Robin Wright, Michael Kelly, Sam Worthington, Keira Knightley, Martin Henderson and Emily Watson. It was directed and produced by Baltasar KormÃ¡kur and written by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy.
 
The film follows two rival expedition groups, one led by Rob Hall (Clarke), who popularized commercial Everest missions, and the other by Scott Fischer (Gyllenhaal), who is known for his laid-back attitude and unconventional methods. The film shows the challenges and dangers faced by the climbers as they cope with high altitude, harsh weather, physical exhaustion and human errors. The film also explores the personal lives and motivations of the climbers, as well as the ethical dilemmas of commercializing the world's highest mountain.
