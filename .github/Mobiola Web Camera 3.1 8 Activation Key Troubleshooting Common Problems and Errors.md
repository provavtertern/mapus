Assetto Corsa is a racing simulation game that features realistic physics, graphics and gameplay. It also has a multiplayer mode that allows players to race against each other online. However, if you have a cracked version of the game, you may not be able to access the official servers or join other players who have the original game. In this article, we will show you how to play Assetto Corsa online with a cracked version using a LAN simulator.
 
## What You Need
 
- A cracked version of Assetto Corsa v1.16.4 or higher. You can download it from [here](https://game3rb.com/assetto-corsa/) [^1^].
- A LAN simulator software such as Hamachi, Tunngle or Evolve. You can download them from their respective websites.
- A Steam account and the Steam client installed on your PC.
- A Steam\_Lan-Fix file that allows you to bypass the Steam authentication. You can download it from [here](https://game3rb.com/assetto-corsa/) [^1^].

## How to Play

1. Extract the cracked version of Assetto Corsa to your preferred location with WinRar or 7-Zip.
2. Copy the content of the Steam\_Lan-Fix file to your game folder and overwrite any existing files.
3. Start Steam and go to your profile.
4. Run the LAN simulator software and create or join a room/lobby with your friend who also has the cracked version of the game.
5. Run the game through AssettoCorsa.exe as administrator.
6. In-game, go to Online -> LAN session ->connect to the server that your friend created or joined.
7. Enjoy racing online with your friend!

## Troubleshooting
 
If you encounter any problems while playing online, here are some possible solutions:
 
**Download Zip ———>>> [https://fienislile.blogspot.com/?download=2uy3ai](https://fienislile.blogspot.com/?download=2uy3ai)**



- Turn off your antivirus and firewall or add an exception for the game and the LAN simulator software.
- If you install games to your system drive, it may be necessary to run this game with admin privileges instead.
- If you want to create your own server, open the server folder located in the game folder and run acServer.exe. Then connect to your server in the game.
- If you want to play on different tracks, you can use the Kissmyrank Plugin Track Rotation that will automatically load the new track as soon as the server track changes. You can download it from [here](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/kissmyrank-assetto-corsa-multiplayer-launcher-mod.18198/) [^4^].

Note: This method is not guaranteed to work for everyone and may violate the terms of service of Steam and Assetto Corsa. We do not condone piracy and recommend buying the original game if you enjoy it.
  
## Why Play Assetto Corsa?
 
Assetto Corsa may not have the most impressive graphics, content or presentation, but it has something that many other racing games lack: a realistic and immersive driving experience. Assetto Corsa is designed to simulate the physics and behaviour of real cars and tracks, using laser scan technology and telemetry data from manufacturers and racing teams. The result is a game that feels authentic and satisfying, where every car has its own personality and every track has its own challenges.
 
Assetto Corsa also gives you a lot of freedom and flexibility to customize your driving experience. You can adjust the driving aids, camera views, force feedback settings, weather conditions, tyre wear, fuel consumption and more. You can also choose from a variety of game modes, including practice, hotlap, time attack, drift, race weekend and online multiplayer. You can even create your own championships and events with the custom mode.
 
## What Are the Drawbacks?
 
Assetto Corsa is not a perfect game, and it has some drawbacks that may frustrate some players. One of them is the career mode, which is poorly designed and boring. You have to complete a series of driving tests and races with different cars and tracks, but there is no sense of progression or reward. The AI opponents are also inconsistent and sometimes unfair, making the races frustrating rather than fun.

Another drawback is the lack of official content. Assetto Corsa has a decent selection of cars and tracks, but it falls short compared to other racing games. It only features GT3 cars and some classic cars, but no other categories or disciplines. It also has only 19 official tracks, most of them European circuits, but no street or oval tracks. The game relies heavily on the modding community to provide additional content, but this may not be accessible or appealing to everyone.
 
## Is It Worth It?
 
Assetto Corsa is not a game for everyone. It is a game for hardcore racing fans who value realism and immersion over graphics and content. It is a game for those who want to feel like they are driving a real car on a real track, with all the nuances and challenges that come with it. It is a game for those who are willing to overlook its flaws and appreciate its strengths.
 
If you are looking for a casual or arcade racing game, Assetto Corsa may not be for you. If you are looking for a comprehensive or polished racing game, Assetto Corsa may disappoint you. But if you are looking for a realistic and satisfying racing simulator, Assetto Corsa may be the best game you can find on consoles.
