## Installing and launching Mimic
 
To use Daz3D Poser Mimic 3.0.1.1, you need to have Poser 6 or higher installed on your computer. You can download Poser from [here](https://www.posersoftware.com/). You also need to have Mimic 3.0.1.1 installed on your computer. You can download Mimic from [here](https://www.daz3d.com/mimic-pro-for-poser). Make sure you have the latest version of both programs.
 
Once you have installed both programs, you can launch Mimic from the Start menu or from the desktop shortcut. You will see the Mimic interface, which consists of four main areas: the Menu bar, the Toolbar, the Timeline, and the Preview window.
  
## Importing or creating a character in Poser
 
To create realistic facial animations for your 3D characters in Poser, you need to have a character that has a compatible face rig and morphs. You can use any of the default characters that come with Poser, or you can import your own custom characters from other programs such as Daz Studio, Blender, or Maya.
 
To import or create a character in Poser, follow these steps:

- Launch Poser and create a new scene.
- Go to File > Import > Wavefront OBJ to import an OBJ file of your character, or go to File > Import > DAZ Studio Scene to import a DAZ file of your character.
- If you imported an OBJ file, you need to apply a texture map to your character. Go to Material Room and select your character's skin material. Then click on the Image Map node and browse for the texture file of your character.
- If you imported a DAZ file, you need to convert your character's rig to a Poser rig. Go to Window > Joint Editor and select your character's head bone. Then click on the Convert button and choose DAZ Studio Rigging to Poser Rigging.
- If you want to use one of the default characters that come with Poser, go to Library > Figures and choose a character from the list.
- Adjust the position and scale of your character as needed.
- Save your scene as a PZ3 file.

## Importing or recording an audio file in Mimic
 
To generate lip-sync and facial expressions for your character in Mimic, you need to have an audio file that contains the speech or sound that you want your character to make. You can import an existing audio file from your computer, or you can record your own voice using a microphone.
